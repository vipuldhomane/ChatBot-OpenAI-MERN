# Smarty OpenAI ChatBot
## Build with ♥ By Vipul Dhomane

#### Tech Stack used 
##### ReactJs, NodeJs, Express, MongoDb, MUI for user interface, TypeScript, JWT 
Smarty AI Chatbot is a smart generative AI model powered by OpenAI’s GPT model. This app can answer any question in the world with analytical thinking and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.

I have built this application using the MERN stack. I have used multiple libraries such as MUI, react-syntax-highlighter, toaster, etc.

Users can create an account and start chatting with the AI. The chats will be saved for each unique user. This is a secure web application with user authentication implemented with the help of JWT authentication.

For the user interface, I have used MUI library based on Google material UI theme.
